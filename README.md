# Marks Music Solutions

Researching music streaming and listening alternatives. Voting with our money.

## Why This Exists

Spotify has made it clear where they stand. This project is about finding and documenting music streaming services, platforms, and tools that **don't** financially support white supremacist movements or the people enabling authoritarian power grabs in the USA.

Every dollar is a vote. Time to spend them somewhere else.

## What We're Looking For

- Music streaming services with ethical leadership and business practices
- Platforms that pay artists fairly
- Services that don't funnel money to fascist-adjacent figures or causes
- Tools for migrating playlists and libraries away from Spotify

## Alternatives Under Research

| Service | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Tidal | Researching | Artist-owned, higher artist payouts |
| Apple Music | Researching | Higher per-stream payouts than Spotify |
| Deezer | Researching | French company, artist-centric payment model |
| Bandcamp | Researching | Direct artist support, pay-what-you-want |
| YouTube Music | Researching | Google-owned, evaluate corporate ties |
| Amazon Music | Researching | Amazon-owned, evaluate corporate ties |
| Qobuz | Researching | Hi-fi focused, French company |
