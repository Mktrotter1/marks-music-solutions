# Marks Music Solutions

Researching music streaming and listening alternatives. Voting with our money.

## Why This Exists

Spotify has made it clear where they stand. This project is about finding and documenting music streaming services, platforms, and tools that **don't** financially support white supremacist movements or the people enabling authoritarian power grabs in the USA.

Every dollar is a vote. Time to spend them somewhere else.

## What We're Looking For

- Music streaming services with ethical leadership and business practices
- Platforms that pay artists fairly
- Services that don't funnel money to fascist-adjacent figures or causes
- Tools for migrating playlists and libraries away from Spotify
- Feasibility of building our own platform

## Top Recommendations

### If you want the cleanest ethics + best audio: **Qobuz**
No political baggage, no scandals, pays artists ~10x Spotify. Best-in-class Hi-Res FLAC audio. Trade-off: less polished app, no free tier.

### If you want mainstream convenience + ethics: **Apple Music** or **Tidal**
Both pay artists significantly more than Spotify with no extremist connections. Apple has the bigger ecosystem; Tidal has better audio and artist-centric payments.

### If you want to directly support artists: **Bandcamp**
A single $10 album purchase = thousands of Spotify streams for the artist. DRM-free files you own forever. Best used alongside a streaming service.

### Recommended combo: **Qobuz or Tidal** (streaming) + **Bandcamp** (direct artist support)

## Building Our Own Platform

Full feasibility study: **[BUILD-YOUR-OWN-FEASIBILITY-STUDY.md](BUILD-YOUR-OWN-FEASIBILITY-STUDY.md)**

### The Short Version

| Approach | Cost (Year 1) | Timeline | Feasibility |
|----------|--------------|----------|-------------|
| Full Spotify competitor | $58M - $228M | 2-3 years | Requires VC. Extremely high risk. |
| Indie/niche streaming (no major labels) | $925K - $2.5M | 12-18 months | Achievable with dedicated funding |
| Artist-direct platform (Bandcamp alt) | $370K - $975K | 6-12 months | Most realistic ethical option |
| Community tools (migration, guides) | $0 - $5K | 1-3 months | Immediate impact, no licensing needed |

The biggest barrier is **licensing**, not technology. Major labels demand $10M-$100M+ in advances. The realistic path: build an artist-direct or indie-focused platform that bypasses major labels entirely, using a cooperative/B-Corp structure with user-centric payments.
