# Bandcamp Platform Research

> **Research Date:** February 2026
> **Note:** This research is compiled from knowledge current through approximately May 2025. Some details (especially around Songtradr's ongoing corporate moves) may have evolved since then. Items marked with [VERIFY] should be confirmed against current sources.

## 1. Ownership & Corporate Structure

### Ownership Timeline

| Period | Owner | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| 2007--2022 | Independent (founder Ethan Diamond, CEO) | Founded in Oakland, CA. Venture-backed but largely operated independently with a strong artist-first ethos. |
| March 2022 | **Epic Games** acquires Bandcamp | Epic (owned by Tim Sweeney) purchased Bandcamp. Framed as supporting the "open internet" and creator economy. |
| September 2023 | **Songtradr** acquires Bandcamp from Epic Games | Epic sold Bandcamp roughly 18 months after acquiring it, during a round of broader Epic layoffs. |

### Current Owner: Songtradr

- **Songtradr** is a **B2B music licensing and distribution company** based in Los Angeles. It operates a marketplace connecting music rights holders with businesses needing licensed music (ads, film, TV, retail, etc.).
- Songtradr is a **privately held** company. It has received venture capital funding from investors including Rampersand, Tidal Ventures, and others.
- CEO: **Paul Shortino** (co-founder of Songtradr). [VERIFY -- leadership may have changed]
- Songtradr's core business is quite different from Bandcamp's direct-to-fan model, which has raised concerns in the independent music community about strategic fit and long-term commitment to Bandcamp's mission.

### Key Corporate Events Post-Acquisition

- **Mass layoffs at Bandcamp (October 2023):** Immediately after the Songtradr acquisition closed, approximately **half of Bandcamp's staff were laid off** -- roughly 58 employees. This included the entire editorial team behind Bandcamp Daily (the platform's acclaimed music journalism outlet).
- **Union busting allegations:** Bandcamp workers had formed **Bandcamp United**, a union affiliated with the Office and Professional Employees International Union (OPEIU Local 1010), which was voluntarily recognized under Epic Games' ownership in 2022. When Songtradr took over, the company **refused to voluntarily recognize the union** and the layoffs disproportionately affected union members, leading to accusations of union busting. The NLRB investigated unfair labor practice charges. [VERIFY current status of NLRB proceedings]
- **Bandcamp Daily:** The editorial operation was gutted in the layoffs. While the site continued in some reduced form, the deep, curated editorial coverage that was a hallmark of the platform was severely diminished.
- Founder **Ethan Diamond** departed during the Epic Games era.

### Political Ties

- **Songtradr** itself does not have a prominent political profile. It is a venture-backed tech/music company without well-known partisan political donations or affiliations.
- **Epic Games / Tim Sweeney:** During Epic's brief ownership, some users noted Tim Sweeney's libertarian-leaning politics and his high-profile legal battles with Apple over app store fees. Sweeney has been a significant donor to **land conservation** causes (donating tens of thousands of acres in North Carolina) but does not have a prominent partisan political donation profile comparable to, say, Peter Thiel. Epic also has a **40% stake owned by Tencent**, the Chinese tech conglomerate, which has drawn scrutiny regarding data privacy and ties to the Chinese government. However, Epic (and by extension Bandcamp during that period) maintained that Tencent had no operational control.
- **No known ties to white supremacist movements or authoritarian figures** for either Songtradr or Bandcamp's current or former ownership.

## 2. Artist Payouts & Revenue Share

### Bandcamp's Cut

| Sale Type | Bandcamp's Cut | Artist/Label Receives |
|-----------|---------------|----------------------|
| **Digital music sales** | **15%** of the sale price | **85%** |
| **Physical merchandise** (vinyl, CDs, cassettes, apparel) | **10%** of the sale price | **90%** |
| **Bandcamp Fridays** (when active) | **0%** | **100%** (minus payment processing) |

- **Payment processing fees** (PayPal or Stripe) are **additional** and typically run around 4--6% depending on geography and payment method. These are separate from Bandcamp's revenue share.
- Artists can set **any price they want**, including "name your price" (pay what you want, including free).
- Fans can pay **above** the listed price, and the full overpayment goes to the artist (minus the same percentage splits).

### How Payouts Work

- Bandcamp holds revenue for a brief period (typically payouts are available within 24--48 hours for digital, longer for physical to account for returns).
- Artists/labels receive payment via **PayPal** or **direct deposit** (in supported countries, via Payoneer in some regions). [VERIFY -- payment methods may have expanded]
- There are **no minimum payout thresholds** that lock up artist earnings for extended periods (unlike some distributors).
- Revenue is **per-transaction** -- artists earn money each time someone buys, not based on fractional-cent streaming rates.

### Comparison to Streaming Services

| Platform | Avg. Per-Stream Payout | Revenue to Artist from $10 Album |
|----------|----------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Bandcamp** | N/A (purchase model) | ~$8.50 (85% of $10, before payment processing) |
| **Spotify** | ~$0.003--$0.005 per stream | An album would need ~2,000--3,300 streams to equal $10 |
| **Apple Music** | ~$0.006--$0.01 per stream | An album would need ~1,000--1,700 streams to equal $10 |
| **Tidal** | ~$0.005--$0.01 per stream | An album would need ~1,000--2,000 streams to equal $10 |
| **YouTube Music** | ~$0.002--$0.005 per stream | An album would need ~2,000--5,000 streams to equal $10 |
| **Amazon Music** | ~$0.003--$0.005 per stream | An album would need ~2,000--3,300 streams to equal $10 |

**Key insight:** For independent and mid-tier artists, a single Bandcamp album purchase is worth **thousands of streams** on any streaming platform. The difference is especially stark for niche genres where artists may have dedicated but smaller fanbases.

## 3. Pricing for Listeners

### Purchasing Music

- **Pricing is set by the artist/label.** There is no platform-mandated price.
- Typical album prices range from **$5--$15** for digital, though artists can set any price.
- **"Name Your Price"** -- artists can allow fans to pay whatever they want, including $0 (free download). Many artists set a minimum price but allow fans to pay more.
- **Individual track purchases** are also available if the artist enables them (typically $1--$2 per track).
- Purchases are **permanent downloads** -- you own the files. No DRM.

### Bandcamp Subscription / Fan Accounts

- **Bandcamp fan accounts are free.** You can create an account, build a collection, follow artists, and discover music at no cost.
- **Artist subscriptions:** Some artists offer a **subscription model** where fans pay a recurring fee (set by the artist, e.g., $5/month or $30/year) and get access to the artist's full catalog plus subscriber-only releases and extras. This is artist-by-artist, not a platform-wide subscription.
- **There is no "Bandcamp Premium" or platform-wide all-you-can-stream subscription** comparable to Spotify Premium or Apple Music. Bandcamp is fundamentally a **purchase** platform, not a streaming platform.
- **Bandcamp app:** The mobile app allows streaming of music you have purchased (your collection), functioning somewhat like a personal music library. You cannot stream music you haven't bought (though you can preview/sample tracks).

### Bandcamp Fridays

- Launched in **2020** during the COVID-19 pandemic as a way to support artists.
- On designated Bandcamp Fridays (typically the first Friday of each month), **Bandcamp waives its revenue share entirely**, meaning artists/labels receive 100% of sales (minus only payment processing fees).
- These events generated **massive spikes in sales** -- often tens of millions of dollars in a single day.
- Bandcamp Fridays were eventually reduced in frequency and then [VERIFY] may have been modified or discontinued under Songtradr ownership. As of late 2023/early 2024, the status of ongoing Bandcamp Fridays was uncertain under new ownership.

## 4. Ethics, Politics & Social Justice

### Positive Initiatives

- **Bandcamp Fridays** (as described above) directed hundreds of millions of dollars directly to artists during the pandemic era.
- **Juneteenth donations:** In June 2020, during the George Floyd protests and racial justice movement, Bandcamp donated its share of all sales on Juneteenth to the **NAACP Legal Defense Fund**. This was repeated in subsequent years.
- **ACLU and Trans rights donations:** Bandcamp has held special fundraising days where its revenue share was donated to organizations like the **ACLU** and the **Transgender Law Center**.
- **Ukraine support:** Bandcamp directed proceeds from a Bandcamp Friday to organizations supporting Ukraine after the 2022 Russian invasion.
- **Bandcamp Daily** (the editorial arm) was widely praised for highlighting diverse, independent, and underrepresented artists across genres and geographies. Its gutting under Songtradr was mourned across the music community.
- **General ethos:** Under its original independent and Epic-era management, Bandcamp was widely regarded as the most **artist-friendly** major music platform. The company was vocal about fair pay for musicians and transparency.

### Concerns & Controversies

- **Songtradr acquisition and layoffs (2023):** The mass layoffs, apparent union busting, and gutting of editorial were the most significant controversies. These shifted community sentiment from viewing Bandcamp as a scrappy, ethical alternative to concerns about its future direction.
- **Union busting:** The refusal to recognize Bandcamp United and the disproportionate layoff of union-organized workers drew significant criticism from labor advocates and the music community. [VERIFY -- NLRB rulings may have come down since May 2025]
- **No known ties to white supremacist movements.** Bandcamp has historically been a platform where anti-fascist, punk, and activist musicians have thrived. The platform has at times removed artists or releases that promote hate speech, though (like any open platform) objectionable content has occasionally appeared.
- **No known political donations** from Bandcamp as a corporate entity to partisan political campaigns or PACs.
- **Content moderation:** Bandcamp has generally been hands-off but has removed content that violates its terms of service regarding hate speech and incitement to violence. It is not known as a haven for extremist content.

### Songtradr-Specific Concerns

- Songtradr's business model centers on **commercial music licensing** (syncing music to ads, retail, etc.), which is a fundamentally different value proposition than Bandcamp's direct-to-fan sales. Some in the music community have raised concerns that Songtradr may seek to **monetize Bandcamp's catalog** for licensing purposes or shift the platform's priorities away from independent artists.
- The speed and scale of post-acquisition layoffs suggested to many observers that Songtradr acquired Bandcamp primarily for its **catalog and technology infrastructure** rather than its community mission.

## 5. Audio Quality & Formats

### Available Download Formats

When you purchase music on Bandcamp, you can download it in **any or all** of the following formats:

| Format | Quality | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| **MP3 320kbps** | Lossy, high-quality | Most compatible; good for casual listening |
| **MP3 V0** | Lossy, variable bitrate | Slightly smaller files, perceptually similar to 320kbps |
| **FLAC** | Lossless | Full CD-quality (or higher if source is hi-res); preferred by audiophiles |
| **ALAC (Apple Lossless)** | Lossless | Same quality as FLAC; native to Apple ecosystem |
| **AAC** | Lossy, high-quality | Good for Apple devices |
| **Ogg Vorbis** | Lossy | Open-source format |
| **WAV** | Uncompressed lossless | Largest files; true uncompressed audio |
| **AIFF** | Uncompressed lossless | Apple's uncompressed format |

### Key Points

- **You get ALL formats with a single purchase.** You are not locked into one format -- you can re-download in any format at any time from your collection.
- Quality depends on what the artist uploads. If the artist uploads a **24-bit/96kHz master**, FLAC and WAV downloads will reflect that hi-res quality. Most uploads are at minimum CD quality (16-bit/44.1kHz).
- **No DRM.** Files are yours to keep, back up, and play on any device.
- **Streaming quality** (for previewing or playing from your collection in the app) is lower-bitrate MP3, typically 128kbps. The full-quality files are only available via download.
- This format selection is **far superior** to Spotify (which streams at up to 320kbps OGG Vorbis with no download/ownership) and comparable to or better than purchasing from services like Apple iTunes/Music or Amazon.

## 6. Pros and Cons: Moving from Spotify to Bandcamp

### Pros

1. **Massively better artist compensation.** A single $10 album purchase puts more money in an artist's pocket than thousands of Spotify streams. For independent and mid-tier artists, this is transformative.

2. **You own your music.** Downloads are DRM-free files you keep forever. If Bandcamp disappeared tomorrow, your downloaded music would still be on your hard drive. With Spotify, you lose access to everything the moment you cancel.

3. **Superior audio quality.** Access to lossless FLAC, WAV, and other formats far exceeds Spotify's streaming quality. Audiophiles can get true hi-res audio.

4. **Direct artist-fan relationship.** You can message artists, follow them, see their updates, and feel a genuine connection to the music you support. Artists can see who their supporters are.

5. **Discovery with depth.** Bandcamp's genre tags, editorial features (to the extent they still exist), and community collections offer a discovery experience that rewards deep listening rather than algorithmic surface-level recommendations.

6. **Transparency.** Bandcamp's revenue split is simple and publicly stated. Spotify's per-stream rates are opaque and constantly shifting.

7. **Supports the independent music ecosystem.** Bandcamp is the primary online marketplace for independent, DIY, and niche genre music. Many artists and labels are exclusively or primarily on Bandcamp.

8. **Physical merchandise.** You can buy vinyl, CDs, cassettes, shirts, and other merch directly from artists -- all in one place.

9. **Pay-what-you-want model.** You can choose to pay more than the asking price if you want to support an artist extra. You can also find free music from artists who offer it.

### Cons

1. **No "all-you-can-eat" streaming.** There is no monthly subscription that gives you unlimited access to all music. Every album or track is a separate purchase. For someone used to Spotify's "everything for $10/month" model, this requires a mindset shift and potentially higher spending.

2. **Catalog gaps.** Major label artists are generally **not** on Bandcamp or have limited presence. If you listen to a lot of mainstream pop, hip-hop, or major-label rock, you will need to supplement Bandcamp with another service. Bandcamp's strength is independent music.

3. **No algorithmic recommendations / playlists.** Bandcamp does not have Spotify's Discover Weekly, Release Radar, or curated playlists. Discovery requires more active effort -- browsing genres, reading reviews, following tags.

4. **Mobile experience is limited.** The Bandcamp app allows streaming of your purchased collection but is not as polished or feature-rich as Spotify's app. No offline mode for streaming (though you can manually load downloaded files onto your phone).

5. **Uncertain future under Songtradr.** The layoffs, union issues, and corporate restructuring raise legitimate questions about the platform's long-term stability and commitment to its original mission. There is a nonzero risk that Songtradr could further degrade the platform, sell it again, or shut it down.

6. **Social features are basic.** No collaborative playlists, no easy sharing to social media with preview cards, no "what are your friends listening to" features that Spotify offers.

7. **Streaming previews are low quality.** When previewing or streaming from your collection in the app, audio is compressed to ~128kbps MP3, which is notably worse than Spotify's high-quality streaming. You need to download files for full quality.

8. **Cost can add up.** If you are an avid music listener who explores dozens of albums per month, purchasing everything on Bandcamp will cost significantly more than a $10/month Spotify subscription. Budget-conscious listeners may need to be more selective.

### Recommended Hybrid Approach

Many music fans find that the best approach is to **use both**:
- **Bandcamp** for artists you love and want to directly support, especially independent artists -- buy their albums, buy their merch.
- **A streaming service** for casual listening, discovery, and access to major-label catalogs.

This way, your dollars go directly to the artists who need it most, while you still have convenient access to a broad catalog for everyday listening.
