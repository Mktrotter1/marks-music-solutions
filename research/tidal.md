## 2. Artist Payouts

| Metric | Tidal | Spotify (comparison) |
|--------|-------|---------------------|
| Per-stream rate | ~$0.012 - $0.013 | ~$0.003 - $0.005 |
| Per million streams | ~$12,000 - $13,000 | ~$3,000 - $5,000 |
| Payment model | Fan-centered (user-centric) | Pro-rata (pool-based) |

### Artist-First Model

1. **Higher royalty rates:** 2x to 4x more per stream than Spotify
2. **Fan-centered royalties (2024):** Your subscription money goes to artists *you actually listen to*, not pooled and split by total stream share
3. **Original artist ownership stakes:** 16 major artists held equity in the 2015 relaunch
4. **Transparent data:** Detailed streaming analytics for artists
5. **No robust free tier exploitation:** Core business is paid subscriptions
